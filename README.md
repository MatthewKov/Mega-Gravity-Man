# Mega-Gravity-Man
Final project for my intro to programming course. Final version

Utilized a module called gamebox required by my professor. The code for gamebox was written by my professor and allowed visual objects to be created and simple physics. Unfortunately, due to quirks with gamebox, we had to write a line of code to instantiate each and every platform.

As the comments at the top of the file indicate, some computers, specifically Macs, did not run the game at the intended speed, and it was determined that this was likely due to differences in hardware or faults in the gamebox code.
